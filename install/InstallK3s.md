## Installing k3s

In this lab, we are going to install and configure k3s on a Raspaberry Pi

### Before we start the lab you need to have <a href="SLESonRPi.md">SLES 15 SP2 installed</a> on your Raspberry Pi.

We will begin this lab as the tux user on your Raspberry Pi

    ssh tux@x.x.x.x

#### Update to the latest patches
```
sudo zypper up
```
##### Ensure you have the needed packages
```
sudo zypper in which
```
##### Punch a hole in the firewall or turn it off
```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=6443/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```
##### OR disable and turn off
```
sudo systemctl disable --now firewalld
```
#### Install k3s via the automated script

We are using the --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 option so the .kube/config file is automatically created
```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.19.8+k3s1 K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE=0644 sh - 
```
The output will look simular to:

```

```

#### Test to see if it's working
```
kubectl get nodes
```
Example:

```
NAME        STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
pi-erin-1   Ready    master   55s   v1.18.9+k3s1
```
##### Want to add bash completion?
```
kubectl completion bash >/etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl
```
Logout and log back in to activate.

##### Need helm to work?

First, Follow the instructions to install Helm in the <a href="InstallKubernetesTools.md">Installation of Kubernetes  Tools</a>

You will not need to install kubectl since the k3s install already did that for you.

###### Export the k3s.yaml
```
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```
or you can symlink it
ensure you have .kube/config in your home directory
for tux use
```
ln -s /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yml /home/tux/.kube/config
```

Done. Time to move on to adding a workload.
